# Car-Racing-game
My semester project. I have used Windows Forms to create this game, because it is a really convenient environment for such job. It automatically created objects for me, so I did not spend the time writing each component. The rest is written using c# language.
The game is not fully finished yet, but the main mechanics is done. Only design remains. Also, you will notice that car models are like squares, so each model have their own black background. I could not find how to fix this, maybe you know, so I would like to hear the idea. For now I guess these are all the problems in this game, if I did not miss something.
