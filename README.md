# Car-Racing-game
My semester project. 
The game is not fully finished yet, but the main mechanics is done. Only design remains. Also, you will notice that car models are like squares, so each model have their own black background. I could not find how to fix this, maybe you know, so I would like to hear the idea. For now I guess these are all the problems in this game, if I did not miss something.
